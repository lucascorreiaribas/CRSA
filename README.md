# Complex Representation for Shape Analysis (CRSA)

## Using
features = CRSA(im,thresholding,Q,W); 

## Input
* im: image 0=background and >0 contour points 
* thresholding: set of threshold values (0.025:0.005:0.95) 
* Q: set of numbers of hidden neurons ([9,19,59]) 
* W: set of window size = [4,7];

## Output 
* features: computed features for shape as Complex Representation
